#About me 
##My Interests 
I love learning new programming languages and have a strong interest in technology. When I'm not programming, I enjoy riding my bike, reading history, and going on nature hikes and hanging out with friendsÂ 
##Websites I Recommed 
-[Google](https://www.google.com)My first choice for topic research and technical problem solving is Google.
-[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) I use YouTube for programming because it provides clear, demonstrated explanations and practical examples that make it easier for me to understand and use programming ideas.
